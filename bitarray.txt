In zeros and ones, it's plain to see
A world of data, a binary sea
But sometimes we need more control
To manage bits, to take a toll

Enter bitarray, a Python friend
A tool to use, a means to an end
A compact form, a space saver
With flexible options, to do us a favor

Manipulate bits with ease and grace
A powerful tool to keep up the pace
A binary dance, a symphony of code
Bitarray is there to carry the load

So let's raise a glass to bitarray's might
For helping us navigate the digital fight
In ones and zeroes, we'll carry on
With bitarray by our side, we'll never be gone.
