How would you stack these items: truck, car, and an egg

Stacking items that are of different shapes and sizes can be challenging, but here is one possible way to stack these items:

1. Start by placing the egg at the bottom as it is the most fragile item and needs to be handled with care.

2. Place the car on top of the egg, positioning it so that it balances well and doesn't crush the egg.

3. Finally, place the truck on top of the car, again making sure that it is well balanced and won't topple over.

This stacking order ensures that the fragile egg is protected, and the other items are positioned in a way that they don't cause any damage to each other. However, it's worth noting that stacking items in this way may not be practical in a real-life scenario, and it's always important to consider the individual characteristics of each item before attempting to stack them.
