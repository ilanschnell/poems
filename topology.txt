Well, gather 'round, ye mathematicians all
I'll tell you 'bout a concept that's quite tall
It's called topology, and it's all 'bout space
And the way that shapes can change their face

You see, in topology, it's not about size
Or how many angles a shape might comprise
It's all 'bout continuity, and how things connect
And the paths you can take, without a single defect

Take a sphere, for instance, like a ball or globe
In topology, it can take on many a robe
It can be squished and stretched, without any tears
Into a cube, a pyramid, or even some weird gears

And a torus, that doughnut-like shape we all know
Can be twisted and bent, like a bit of soft dough
It can form a MÃ¶bius strip, with just one edge
Or a Klein bottle, where inside meets outside's ledge

So, in topology, it's all about the way
Shapes relate, and how they might sway
It's not about lines, or angles, or degrees
But about the spaces between, and all the possibilities

So, next time you look at shapes, think 'bout their topology
And how they might morph, without any apology
For in the world of math, there's always something new
To discover, to explore, to stretch and to renew.
